            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There is a ſhort, but ſad <hi>complaint,</hi> which I have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, written in the name of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of this <hi>Country,</hi> to this effect. <q>1 That in ſeverall great Pariſhes, Market Towns and other, Miniſters are placed, who own but a very few as Members of their Church, and preach judgement to the reſt, and deprive them and their children of the Sacraments, and other Miniſterial Offices (yet receive the profits) and account them but as Heathens, except they will enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42563:4"/> their private Covenant. 2 That the ſaid Preachers wander abroad with their Diſciples after them, invade other mens pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, diſtract the people, and alienate their mindes from their lawful Paſtors. 3 That they ſpread (under pretence of preaching Chriſt) very dangerous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt pariſh-Churches, and pariſh-Miniſters, and againſt that order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment that ought to be reſtored to the Church of God. 4 That the ſaid prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers pretend to be the men, by whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or disfavour other Miniſters muſt ſtand or fall: Whoſe Ordination they call Antichriſtian, and have a deſigne to plant their illiterate followers (whom they <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> to that end) in their places. Theſe</q> and the like grievances we hope Authority will in time redreſſe: In the mean time, it is the duty of Miniſters that are left of the old ſtock, to teach the truth and warn the people of theſe errors: To which purpoſe the following Papers are not of no uſe.

            <p>And of theſe we ſhall note ſomething in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the printed Papers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For Church-Government</hi> I cannot blame the <hi>Reſpondent,</hi> who had lived under the form of Epiſcopacy, to own that ancient way. He denies it not to have been ſubject unto faults and errors by the miſcarriage of perſons employed; whoſe faults, if they ſhoud be charged likewiſe upon other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, no form, neither Civil nor Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, would be of any long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. I ſuppoſe it were <hi>a good Reformation,</hi> to make ſome amendment in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Lawes</hi> (as about the abilities required in perſons to be Ordained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and to bring up the <hi>practice</hi> of the Church to the Laws. That Epiſcopacy is not to be caſt off, we the Ancients, <hi>Ignatius</hi> and little reading in are verily perſwaded by our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by what we find in our own beſt Reformed Divines. No more need here be named but <hi>Zanchy</hi> from beyond ſea, and Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> at home (whoſe words you have in the Teſtimonies) Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42563:5"/> (a man worthily much eſteemed by all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) ſaith, <hi>that among many Presbyters, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Word and Sacraments in ſome one City, there was one by the Apoſtles themſelves, ſet over the reſt, and (indowed) with a certain ſingular dignity and power. And it is manifeſt, theſe Biſhops thus eſtabliſht by the Apoſtles autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had their ſucceſſions in the ſame Cities by a continual order.</hi> And <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith, <hi>That in the Proteſtant Churches are not wanting Biſhops and Archbiſhops indeed and in effect: But the good Greek names being changed into bad Latin, they call them Superintendents and general Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents. And where theſe names are not, yet there are wont to be ſome prime men, who have almoſt all the Authority. And why ſhould we contend about names, when we agree about the thing?</hi> I will onely adde upon this firſt Head, what I hear is not diſpleaſing to the Presbyterians, I wiſh it may not be to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents (<hi>whoſe chief Argument from</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>for the power of the Congregation, is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by conſidering, that matters ſeem to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the people, becauſe they paſſed at their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, though under cenſure of Biſhops and Presbyters.</hi> See page 112.) Namely the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that moſt Reverend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Primate, Dr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> now with God: who in four Articles lately printed, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42563:5"/> Epiſcopacy to the form of Synodical Government. The ſumme is this, <q>1 That in every pariſh the Rector with the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens note the ſcandalous and admoniſh them. 2. That they preſent the obſtinate to the monthly rural Synod, conſiſting of the Rectors of that part aſſembled under the Suffragan there to be cenſured. 3. That the Acts of the monthly Synods be reviſed once or twice a year by the Dioceſan Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, conſiſting of all the ſuffragans and ſome choice Rectors aſſembled under the Biſhop. 4. That further Appeal may be made, in caſe of grievances, to the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Synods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a way of conjoyning <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and <hi>Presbyterial</hi> into one: which might happily content all ſober Chriſtians, ſo as Church-affairs ſhould be managed (to borrow words from the royal pen) neither with tyranny, impurity, nor popularity: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops ejected, nor Presbyters deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor people oppreſſed: <hi>Whom God hath joyned together, let no man put aſunder.</hi> So much of the firſt Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For Publick prayers.</hi> I ſee no cauſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlike that which is (among the following teſtimonies) cited out of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Lord Protector, wherein he ſaith,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42563:6"/> 
               <hi>I very much approve a certain form of prayers, from which it may not be lawful for the Paſtors in their function to depart; for theſe reaſons, that help may be given to the unskilfulneſſe of ſome: that the conſent of all the Churches may appear; that the levity and uncertainty of ſome men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffecting novelties, may be regulated and reſtrained.</hi> Yet neither doth <hi>Calvin</hi> here, nor do any of us deny a grave, modeſt, diſcreet and humble uſe of Miniſters gifts, even in publick, the better to fit &amp; excite their own and the peoples affections to the preſent occaſions. But that any mens private &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Abilities ſhould quite juſtle out the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick forms of prayer, compoſed by the joynt Abilities and gifts of Godly learned Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, this is that we cannot allow of. Neither do we conceive the ſpirit of prayer to conſiſt ſo much in utterance of words, which is but a gift of edification, as in ſtirring up the Graces of faith and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and other gifts of ſanctification, wherein the very life and ſoul of prayer conſiſteth. And certianly he that ſaith, that ſhort comprehenſive prayer (juſtly called <hi>The Lords prayer,</hi> becauſe he framed it for his Diſciples) with an underſtanding, devout and faithfull heart, prayes very ſpiritually, very acceptably, and powerfully. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42563:6"/> this prayer, I cenſure it as too yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſpoken, which is ſaid in the firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if the words might be laid aſide and omitted, the ſenſe being kept: When as, in my opinion, it is an honour to our Saviour, and a good mark of his humble and faithful followers, to keep not the ſenſe onely, but the very form of words which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: Nor can I ſee any reaſon why ſo many in theſe times do omit the form, as if that omiſſion were now become a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive character, whereby the moſt godly preachers and moſt Reformed Chriſtians might be known. But enough of this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the Ordination and power of Miniſters, that Text (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.) inſiſted on in the Diſpute (adde <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23.) plainly ſhews the <hi>Apoſtolical practice</hi> of Ordaining El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in every Church; and in ſucceeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a ſucceſſion of Chriſts Miniſters was preſerved by the like Ordination, as <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Records</hi> do abundantly witneſs. That Churches parochial ſhould be filled with thoſe that ſet up <hi>a new or no form</hi> of worſhip, and miniſter holy things before they have received <hi>holy Orders,</hi> this I think was never heard of in our land, before theſe our times; and what the conſequence will be, we have great cauſe to fear, even the overthrow of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42563:7"/> all Religion, and the introducing of Atheiſm and prophaneſs among our people. Thoſe words in the late <hi>Mournfull Complaint,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to ſome Parliament men, are to the purpoſe: <hi>You have placed in many of our Churches, and given the Tithes, and other profits belonging to the cure of ſouls, to men that refuſe to take any ſuch charge upon them, and who are ſo far from having the affections, or performing the duties of faithful Paſtors to us, that they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly diſown any ſuch relation, and conſequently all the duties thereunto belonging: Thence they neither Baptiſe nor Catechiſe our children, nor do they administer the Lords Supper in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, our ſick and feeble perſons they viſite not, nor own it as a duty incumbent on them to take care for our ſouls.</hi> Theſe Miniſters I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, being not Ordained, believe their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial power to reach onely to thoſe ſelect perſons that are in Covenant with them, and ſubmit to their Church-way, as if the ſaid power were received from the perſons that conſent thereunto. Thus have we Miniſters that are <hi>Preachers</hi> to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thouſands, and <hi>Ministers</hi> (as themſelves ſay) to ſome few gathered out of the multitude; the reſt of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the mean time remaining (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their opinion) almoſt in the quality of meer Heathens and Infidels: and if they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42563:7"/> be not ſuch, this ſeemeth a way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o make them ſo. For, being not owned as Brethren by the gathered Church, and having good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not to come into their communion, they are in many places deſtitute of divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, without publick Prayers, Sermons, Sacraments, and in a ready way to looſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion altogether. But why do they not come into the Preachers placed among them by Authority? Becauſe they believe thoſe Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, however ſettled by the civil power, have not received the ſacred Office by lawful Ordination: For we may eaſily diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Office</hi> and the <hi>place</hi> wherein the Office is exerciſed. Preachers and Miniſters are placed, and confirmed in their places by the Magiſtrate or Civil power, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their miniſterial Office, or ſpiritual function by lawful Ordination, and laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. This is called the Power of Order, derived, not from the Magiſtrate or Prince; not from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (they cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Miniſters, Servants, Officers</hi> and <hi>Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> of Chriſt, muſt have their Authority and Commiſſion from Chriſt, either <hi>immediately,</hi> as the Apoſtles had, or <hi>mediately</hi> by the hands
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42563:8"/> of Elder Miniſters, as the lawful Miniſters of our time have; nor may any take this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto himſelf, but he that is thus called of God. The people indeed may be ſaid to <hi>Call,</hi> that is, to <hi>invite</hi> and intreate Miniſters to come unto them, but their <hi>Calling</hi> or <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is from God. The Lord of the harveſt <hi>ſends</hi> in the laborers; the great Shepheard <hi>ſetteth</hi> Paſtors over his flock; the Maſter of the Family <hi>appointeth</hi> Stewards for his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould to diſpence unto them the Myſteries of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For the adminiſtration of the holy Sacrament, that ſuch as have not received the <hi>power</hi> before mentioned by lawful Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, do not adminiſter the Sacrament to all, we will not blame them, becauſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they have not power of miniſtring to <hi>any one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And this is diſcovered in the enſuing Papers; where the Author endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on the one ſide to avoid the <hi>preciſeneſs</hi> of ſome, that admit to the holy Table onely ſome <hi>few</hi> perſons choſen out of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds; and the <hi>looſneſſe</hi> of ſome on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, who admit hundreds and exclude not ſome <hi>few;</hi> namely, ſuch as are ignorant and ſcandalous, ſuch he would have <hi>noted,</hi> kept back and avoided, if after due admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions they will not be amended.

The more cauſe have I to note either the want of charity, or want of care in that Writer, who in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Preface</hi> hath ſnatched the Argument out of the Letter <hi>May</hi> 26 and contrary to the Authors minde and the many expreſſions in the Book, put upon him this Theſis, <hi>That the ignorant and ſcandalous muſt be admitted to the Communion:</hi> For it is one thing to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacrament in a Congregation, <hi>though mixt, i. e.</hi> though after your diligence in doing your part, there be a mixture of good and bad, as there will be while men are men; and it is another thing to adminiſter careleſly to all ſorts, without preparation, without obſervation, without ſuſpenſion of ſuch as the Miniſter is aſſured, are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving any benefit thereby. That the fear of a mixture is not reaſon enough to forbear the Sacrament, is (we ſtill believe) evinced by ſome (at leaſt) of thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How they are perverted by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, the impartiall Reader will eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, if he pleaſe to compare the places. I will here mention onely the laſt. <hi>As we offer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42563:9"/> the Covenant to All, ſo muſt we offer the Seal to All, that do outwardly ſubmit to the Covenant.</hi> Out of theſe words the Repeater frames this Argument: <hi>The Covenant muſt be offered to all; Therefore the Sacrament muſt be offered to all, even to the ignorant and ſcandalous:</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the qualification added to <hi>All</hi> in the Letter; namely, <hi>that outwardly ſubmit to the Covenant,</hi> by which he might if he had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, have underſtood, thoſe <hi>that profeſſe faith and repentance,</hi> and <hi>outwardly</hi> or in the eye of their neighbours, are not rebellious againſt good counſell and admonition: If profeſſion of faith and repentance, that is, a voluntary ſubjection to the Goſpel be not the proper Quality of a <hi>Receiver,</hi> what is? And when ſhall Miniſters perform their duty of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, if they muſt behold firſt the work of Grace wrought in the <hi>heart</hi> of every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver? Let the Miniſter inſtruct, exhort, admoniſh his people; let the people alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and admoniſh one another, yea let them <hi>ſeparate and gather</hi> as long as they will; yet ſtill there will be a mixture: Perfect pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is reſerved for heaven.

Mr. <hi>Barkſdale</hi> was of all men moſt ready (being the neareſt neighbour) to co-operate in a work tending to the benefit of that old Town; and I have heard him ſay, he ſhould be very unmindfull of the good example of his Father and eldeſt Brother, that aregon before, if he ſhould not in his way alſo ſtudy the good of that place of his Birth: and it is Poverty only, which like an armed man keeps him off from being an eminent Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor there. He had the more hope of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, becauſe Mr. <hi>Helme</hi> was then lookt upon, not only by thoſe of the Pariſh that brought him thither, but by others too, even thoſe of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:42563:13"/> Intereſt, as a man diligent in his calling charitable to the poor, fair-condition'd in his behaviour, and moderate in point of religion. So that, as yet, the people of all ſorts heard him gladly. Mr. <hi>Barkſdale</hi> was the more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his good opinion of his Moderation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in familiar conference heard him much commend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his writings, a man indeed worthy of much commendation, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his great love and ſtudy of the Churches Peace. God direct him and all others in the right way unto it. Well, the Lecture began, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> of <hi>Blockley</hi> (one whom Mr. <hi>Barkſdale</hi> profeſſeth to honour for his Chriſtian temper, and the lovely Graces he hath obſerved in him,) being the firſt preacher; and, I remember, before he came, Mr. <hi>Helme</hi> entertained the Hearers with expounding of the beginning of the 122. Pſalm, <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me, Let us go into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> Which ſudden exerciſe of his was ſo well approved by Mr. <hi>Barkſdale,</hi> that ſome dayes after (being a little given to the Muſes, becauſe of his daily converſation with ſome young Gentlemen-Scholars that live with him) he ſent Mr. <hi>Helme</hi> this following Anagram:</p>

                  <p>SIR, My reſpects remembred, I take leave to trouble you with this Paper, fearing leſt the Diſcourſe that paſt on Tueſday create ſome further unneceſſary diſpute. For preventing whereof, it will be good, I think, to mark what is the meaning of both parties. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, 'tis this: You lay by the Lord's prayer, not as if you did not hold it to be a prayer lawfull, yea and commendable to be uſed in the prayers of the Church (ſo the Divines of the Aſſembly call it p. 18. 19. of the Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;) And you would have people know, that we may pray very acceptably, though not in thoſe very words. And ſo, whereas it is conceived ſome have ſet up that to the diſadvantage of other prayers, or perhaps been a little ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
<pb facs="tcp:42563:14"/> in honouring the former, you would bend the ſtick the other way, and by omitting for a time the uſe of the words, (though you keep the matter ſtill) teach people to regard the ſenſe as the onely thing. Wherein you are not, I think, oppoſed by the other ſide, who hold the prayer to have been uſed, by Chriſt's appointment, by the Diſciples, and fit to be uſed by us: (How can this be denied?) yet do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but the words may lawfully be omitted, and the ſenſe kept. And ſurely, it were a very great reſtraint of Devotion to confine it to any Forms whatſoever; my particular neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities being not particularly provided for by the forms of any other. Which neceſſities yet my heart may much deſire to open to God. And the like may be ſaid ſometime of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; So that, as every Chriſtian muſt labour to expreſs himſelf in private (beyond forms;) ſo every Miniſter muſt endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ability to deliver to God the needs of his people, as the exigent ſhall require. And the exigent doth not always admit of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. To conclude, we gladly uſe the help our Lord, and his ſervants that have gon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore us, have afforded us; We value their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and uſe them; We do alſo after their pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and agreeable to them frame other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for our uſe; And yet after all prepared
<pb facs="tcp:42563:15"/> prayer, the Chriſtian Soul muſt be allowed her ſudden ejaculations and extemporall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſions to the Throne of Grace. What would you have more, &amp;c.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I much commend what you ſaid well of brotherly union and love, but cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with this new buſineſs of ſeparation. Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Admonition alſo I much deſire ſhould be more practiſed, but ſuſpenſion before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition I cannot allow of. Clearly, my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, notwithſtanding all that I have heard from you and your Brethren, that Miniſters are not to be condemn'd by you for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in their Congregations, though mixed. And for the proof here of I do humbly tender unto you and yours theſe following Reaſons, which I ſhall be ready to enlarge and preſs more Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically, if it be deſired.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>precept,</hi> Do this in remembrance of me. <hi>This remembrance ſhould be frequent, and not delayed from year to year, on pretence of unpreparedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>I argue from Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>example. As he waſhed the feet of</hi> Judas <hi>among the reſt, ſo (if you will hear the Expoſitors antient and recent of beſt account) he admitted</hi> Judas <hi>to the Sacrament: though he well knew his
<pb facs="tcp:42563:16"/> unworthineſs, and Miniſters do not know the unworthineſs of thoſe they admit, but hope the beſt, upon their profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>From the Apoſtles words,</hi> Ye ſhew forth the Lords death: <hi>The Lords death is ſhewed forth to the Ear of the unworthy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, why may it not to the Eye alſo of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, though in the Event he prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>From thoſe words of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith,</hi> The word is the ſavour of death to ſome. <hi>Yet the danger of that muſt not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Miniſters from preaching in mixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: and therefore the danger of the unworthineſs of ſome Receivers muſt not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the adminiſtration of the Sacrament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>I allege the example of the Apoſtles, who upon profeſſion of Faith Baptized whole multitudes, and no doubt communicated with them; although it appeared after that they were not all right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>St.</hi> Paul, <hi>directing his Epiſtles to mixt Congregations, calls them all Saints, becauſe of their holy calling and profeſſion: and thoſe that are Saints in reputation may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>In the Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſorderly perſons (beſides the inceſtuous perſon) that were admitted. And</hi> 1 Cor. 11.
<pb facs="tcp:42563:16"/> 
                     <hi>Where he blames their comming together for the worſe, he forbids them not to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor doth he check the Miniſter, and forbid him to offer the Sacrament, but, ſaith he,</hi> Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo—<hi>Neither doth the unworthy eat damnation to the Miniſter, or any other, but only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nor is the Cup of bleſſing turned by the Minister into a Cup of poyſon: (God forbid ſuch language of yours,) but the unworthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the cup of bleſſing loſes the bleſſing through his unworthineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>As the word becomes the ſavour of death to the unworthy, ſo are their prayers abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet you both receive them to the Word, and joyn with them in Prayer; and you ſing Pſalms with them, namely the 100. Pſalms,</hi> We are his flock, he doth us ſeed, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>As the Word is a quickning Ordinance, ſo the Sacrament is a quickning Ordinance; For it is always accompanied with the Word. Nay without the Word 'tis no Sacrament. If the Word, without the Sacrament, may quicken thoſe that were dead, much more may the Word with the Sacrament. Chriſt is the Bread of life, both to give life, and to maintain life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>You do, I ſuppoſe, admit Children of all Chriſtian parents (upon their deſire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) to the one Sacrament; why do you not
<pb facs="tcp:42563:17"/> admit the parents themſelves likewiſe to thè other?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>You have no power to receive accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and proofs of Witneſſes, without which you cannot give ſentence; and will you condemn and ſuſpend, or excommunicate, before you have try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or upon hear-ſay?</hi> Quis erit innocens?</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>You ſay you make a ſeparation in the Church, not from the Church; as if it were lawfull to make a ſeparation in the Church. A ſeparation in the Church is a rent of the Church, is offenſive, and ſaddens the heart of many pious, diſcreet, and charitable perſons, that however they like you otherwiſe, cannot joyn with you in your by-way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>We muſt not deny the worthy, and keep from them the means and pledges of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the unworthineſs of ſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>As we offer the Covenant to all, ſo muſt we offer the ſeal to all, that do outwardly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, I will add no more at preſent: theſe Arguments thus briefly ſet down, you may conſider of impartially. I have left a margin for your Annotations, and deſire you to note what you allow, and what you diſlike, and ſo return my paper; that I may endeavour to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you, ſo far as it becomes one that is a friend to you, and to the people among whom
<pb facs="tcp:42563:17"/> you are Miniſter. I muſt not end, till I have (as I think it my duty) admoniſht you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the Meditations you delivered yeſterday, and in your ſecond thoughts judge, whether it he right and charitable to preach,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church were heretofore impoſed as neceſſary or equall to Gods Law. See to the contrary in the preface to the Liturgy,</hi> of Ceremonies, why ſome are retained.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That a Church of Saints might fifteen years ago beſt be gathered out of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That God will add to your ſeparating Church ſuch as ſhall be ſaved; [as if ſalvation were not to be had elſwhere.</hi>]</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That Liturgy hath done much hurt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. [Remember the fallacy of</hi> non cauſa pro cauſa.]</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>That the Miniſters that joyn not with you, harden people in their ſins, and favour their wickedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>That the Apoſtle ſpeaking of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from diſorderly walkers, forbids to eat the Sacrament with them, though they were not excommunicate.

                     <p>YOU were a little troubled, me thought, with that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. concerning not eating with the offending Brother; and you held it lawfull to eat familiarly, (or at the common Table) with him, but not at the Holy Table. Your reaſon: becauſe it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſo to eat with Infidels. Sir, you are twice miſtaken; for it was clearly permitted to keep company and eat with Infidels, though not with the brother. Read the place. And the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of eating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but common bread. A Chriſtian muſt be ſo far from familiar converſe with ſuch a brother, that he muſt not ſo much as eat with him;—<hi>No, not to eat.</hi> He muſt avoid his familiar company, leſt he partake in his ſin, whom he knows to be covetous, a railer, a drunkard, &amp;c. But, if they both chance to meet at the Lords Table (the offender being not under publick cenſure of Authority) there he may accompany him in that good Action, and not be polluted by him; for the Action is good, and the inward unworthineſs is his own guilt, and hurts not another. The end of this Averſation from the offending brother is for his good, for his converſion; <gap reason="foreign">

My Brethren, there are ſome touches of the Law and Superſtition on you. You know what a ſacred thing was made of the Communion-Table, when the Rayl was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Now I pray, think how you refine and ſpiritualize your old ſuperſtition, by putting a ſpiritual rail about the Sacrament, when you debar poor ſinners from coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                     <hi>GOod Sir, The good reſpect I ever bore to your induſtry, learning, peaceableneſs
<pb facs="tcp:42563:19"/> and integrity, makes me, having ſeen a letter of yours, ſavouring of ſome ſharpneſs, to be bold to give you advice worth gold. 1. That you would write no more ſuch letters: you know not what uſe may be made of it. If you had the letter again, I think you would never ſend it. 2. That you will not think your ſelf ingaged in conſcience to contend againſt any particular form or diſciplin tolerated by the Magiſtrate, eſpecially ſeeing I and the reſt do by no means judge any man to be ſcandalous, becauſe he is not of our form, but deſire all brotherly love and fellowſhip with you and them.

                     <hi>The Anſwer returned</hi> Junii 5.</head>
                  <p>WOrthy Sir, Although my Letter, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as I conceive) on a very juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in a friendly manner to Mr. <hi>Helm,</hi> be not yet vouchſafed any anſwer, yet have I this fruit of it, that you, upon ſight thereof, have been pleaſed thus far to ſhew your love to the Writer, as to give me your Advice: Advice led in by ſo favourable an elogy of your undeſerving friend, that were the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition ſharper than any point of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:42563:19"/> yet ſhould I think my ſelf bound to take it well. <hi>Monere &amp; Moneri:</hi> you know the reſt. I do not only not take it ill, but heartily thank you for it, and will obey it, preferring your judgment herein before mine own. For truly when I conſult with my ſelf (give me an ingenuous liberty to ſpeak a little boldly with you) I can ſee no cauſe but I may write more ſuch letters. That letter hath two parts: one defenſive of many Miniſters, for their life and learning, well approved; the other admonitory, deſiring a reviſall of ſome points deliverd by that Preacher my friend. In the Defenſe I have certainly ſaid ſomewhat that cannot be refuted by ſilence; nor, as I think, by words: And in my Admonition, I have touched that which ought to be retracted, or at leaſt excuſed. Why am I not anſwered by letter; if I am wrong, to be reduced or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; if I am right, to be confirmed. To give no Anſwer, in ſuch a caſe, I confeſs I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reconcile with the Rules of humanity which I have learned, and which I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my friend would not tranſgreſs. The true uſe of a letter is thereby to underſtand the writers mind, and ſo to give him anſwer: what other uſe may be made of it (as you ſay) truly I know not; but I eſteem it not worthy to be ſeen by Superiours, againſt whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:42563:20"/> command, I am ſo far from contending, that I will not publickly condemn what they publickly commend. But (to ſpeak to your ſecond) it hath been eſteemed heretofore very conſcientious to contend againſt ſome things tolerated by the Magiſtrate; So did many zealous Preachers contend againſt ſports on the Lords day tolerated once, and ſo do ſome ſtill contend againſt Uſury tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yet. And for Forms and Diſcipline, the Old way, you know, was preached down, when the Laws and Magiſtrates did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to uphold it. Theſe preachers I cannot defend, but would ſay ſomething for them, if it had been a Form tolerated only, and not eſtabliſht. For we look upon a Form tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a thing not approved by the State, but winked at for a time, and diſpenſt with to content a party or ſide. A Form tolerated is at moſt but for triall: and ſo long as it is put to the triall, it may be contended againſt, not by force, but by argument and diſſwaſion. Nor is this to oppoſe the State, or croſs their Intention; for til they declare their Mind, it is preſumption in a private man to intrude into their Counſells. And therefore while things are under Conſultation (as now) it cannot be juſtly called oppoſition of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, if one diſpute (in a familiar letter)
<pb facs="tcp:42563:20"/> againſt that which they tolerate. Nay, the liberty of familiar letters, you know, is of greater extent. For my part, there is none gives more to the Magiſtrate in matters of Religion, that I do; none is more ready to ſubmit to laws in all things not cleerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Higheſt Law. And for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Toleration, although I think I may ſafely take the liberty (is not this alſo a part of the Toleration?) to diſcourſe of ſuch matters either by letter or otherwiſe; yet I will obey your Advice, as I ſaid: and I cannot chuſe but commend your Moderation in not judging any man ſcandalous for not being of your Form. Though out of Form, I am really, Sir, your Servant in Chriſt.</p>

                  <head>Another to the ſame, not long aſter.</head>
                  <p>GOod Sir, Having not the leaſure at preſent to attend you at <hi>Stow,</hi> I ſend my letter to to ſalute you and your good company. I have conſidered upon your Argument yeſterday (taking advantage from the rubric in our Service-Book) That Catechizing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation muſt go before the Sacrament of of the Lords Supper: Therefore your New Covenant. The Antecedent is in the rubric after the Form of Confirmation. And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:42563:21"/> defend the former neglect of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Biſhop, nor any preſent neglect of Catechizing by any Miniſter. But ſeeing there is now none of that Confirmation to be had (a great want in the Church I think) what if the Miniſter do his part in inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people in the Catechiſm, and the people not only make Confeſſion of Faith, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Repentance, Charity, Obedience; nor hath the Miniſter any aſſurance, no nor juſt ground of ſuſpicion that they are not ſincere, ſhall he not admit them to the Lords Table? I would not preſume to condemn all the pious and learned Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that have adminiſtred the Sacrament upon ſuch tearms. When we cannot have all done we would, we muſt be content with what can be done, as the caſe ſtandeth, Well, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation I grant is commanded as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and profitable, not ſo neceſſary, but that, in caſe it be wanting, the Sacrament may be adminiſtred. Now, to the ſequel: How your Covenant can ſerve in place of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I do not yet underſtand. It conſiſteth only of the Confeſſion, reſolution and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Covenanters: whereas Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or laying on of hands, is an act of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to certify the perſon confirmed, of Gods favour and gracious goodneſs towards him:
<pb facs="tcp:42563:21"/> and it is joyned with prayer and benediction, wherwith the party is thought to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and encreas'd in grace. Your Covenant, I grant, is ſomewhat like the Anſwer in our Catechiſm, where the Catechized underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Baptiſmall vow made in his name, and promiſeth by Gods help to perform it. And ſurely that is done by all that come with us to the Lords Table. And approaching to it in the quality of ſuch as repent them truly of all their ſins, are in charity with their neighbours, and intend to lead a new life, they do renew their Covenant, and in taking the Sacrament have the ſeal thereof: as tis very requiſite, nor do I yet ſee how Miniſters can refuſe to give it.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſhall I be bold in ſecret to ask you, what great deliverance is the ground of your Covenant. I doubt of it, becauſe upon the late deliverance from the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Invaſion, all hopes were cut off of reforming this Church according to the pattern of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which, unleſs I am deceived, was one end of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Covenant receiv'd in <hi>England.</hi> I deny not great Deliverances, but I take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenant, and ſay, that the Friends thereof, inſtead of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, have had a totall overthrow. Give me a little light in this, and reconcile the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb facs="tcp:42563:22"/> in the religious part of them: for I meddle not with temporals.</p>
                  <p>That which you ſaid (as I take it) of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples having excommunicated themſelves, by a defection from the Goſpel in life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which is you ſay in effect all one as to fall from the Faith, muſt be explaned by you. For Apoſtacy from the Faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt cuts a member off from the Church, and Corruption in manners doth but make a diſeaſed member, and ſuch a one muſt be cured gently.</p>
                  <p>I remember a Covenant ſomewhere in Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> his 7. Treatiſes, a Book Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to King <hi>James:</hi> I would gladly know, whether ſuch a one as that might not ſerve your turn,</p>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>WE do in thankfulneſs acknowledge the great Mercy of God, in not giving us up utterly to confuſion and deſolation, but preſerving us under</hi> any <hi>Government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Law and Juſtice is ſo adminiſtred, that we may (if we be not wanting to our ſelves) lead a</hi> quiet <hi>and a</hi> godly <hi>life; And we content our ſelves with the preſent State, not ſeditiouſly ſeeking after changes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>We do much honour the Church of</hi> England, <hi>wherein we have been Baptized and bred; and, notwithſtanding any ſmall
<pb facs="tcp:42563:25"/> faults in the Conſtitution and Diſciplin, or great faults in the late Officers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof, we inſiſt upon the ſame Grounds, and adhere to the ſame Church, as it was in Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>time defended againſt the Roman by</hi> Jewels Apology, <hi>and againſt the Innovators by Hookers</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Politie.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Yet do we not think all the forms and rites thereof ſo neceſſary, but that we may (as diſcretion ſhall require) omit them upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and in their ſtead (without coutempt of the former) uſe ſome that are different and ſerve well for order and decency in the ſervice of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>To reſt in any forms and rites what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and to ſerve God only externally, we hold a very imperfect and unacceptable ſerving of God, who requireth chiefly the heart.

                        <p n="6">6. <hi>That Sum of Religion contained in the old</hi> Catechiſm, <hi>we do eſpecially commend for the education of Children: And we ſhall then think our ſelves good proficients in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when, with the profeſſion of the neceſſary Articles of</hi> Faith, <hi>and due participation of the</hi> Sacraments, <hi>and frequency of the</hi> Word <hi>and</hi> Prayer, <hi>we joyn the careful daily</hi> practice <hi>of Gods moral Law, and of thoſe excellent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical precepts of our only Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                        <p n="8">8. <hi>That we may (for the preſent) ſupply the want of publick Church-Government, as well as we can, we reſolve to put into more diligent practice that command of Chriſt concerning</hi> fraternal Admonition; <hi>Firſt, by

                  <p>
                     <hi>MR. Helme,</hi> I have this long time much deſired ſome friendly conference with you, but not yet finding the opportunity, I take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſend you this Letter after my former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which I ſuppoſe you received, though you returned no anſwer. I would not divert you from your better thoughts by troubling
<pb facs="tcp:42563:27"/> you to give any long anſwer, a few lines ſhall be ſufficient to me. Only be pleaſed to let me know the reaſons of that vehemence you have often uſed in condemning your neighbours, Miniſter, and people, particularly for the Holy Sacrament adminiſtred among them. Muſt we forbear that part of our Miniſtry, becauſe ſome are unworthy receivers? Then it ſeems we may not preach for fear our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons may prove the ſavour of death to ſome. The accidentall evill following by reaſon of ſome (not known) defect in the recipient is no diſcharge to the Miniſter, nor need it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him from doing his part. But we muſt not admit the unworthy. Nor do we admit any but upon an apparent worthineſs, that is, upon profeſſion of Faith, and repentance, and newneſs of life. But they make not good their promiſes: The more are they to blame, that do not. Let not their falſneſs be laid upon the Miniſter; for he's not guilty of it, no more than a Magiſtrate that gives an oath to Jurors which they through their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence do not performe; or than a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; that offers an Engagement or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to people, when yet ſome of them are found afterwards to have entred into it not ſincerely. Sir, I cannot ſee, how you can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your ſelf at any time, ſo that your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie
<pb facs="tcp:42563:28"/> may not be employed on thoſe who may (poſſibly) turne it to their hurt. Thoſe bloody words that are reported to have fallen from you in publick concerning people in Hel crying out upon Miniſters for damning them by giving them the Holy Myſteries, cannot be excuſed; Nor are you to cenſure any for unworthy receiving unleſs you know them to be ſuch; and if you do know them to be ſuch, I think you are rather to admoniſh them in privat, and pray for them, than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likly to rage againſt them. I will not trouble you with more of this. Yet one word more I muſt take leave to add, and ask of you, Why you complained to the Juſtices at <hi>Winch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb</hi> Seſſions laſt that you had malignant Neighbours. Sir, you are not to endanger any man's name or eſtate by ſuch a character that is a profeſſor of that Religion which Chriſt hath taught, that ſubmits to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers, that deſires to live peaceably with all men. Such a one particularly doth he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs himſelf to be in truth, who alſo is,</p>

                     <hi>A Reply preſently upon receipt of Anſwer to the letter of May 23. Jun.</hi> 8. 53.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>To ſhew my reſpect unto you, and the deſire I have you ſhould have any fair ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction concerning my doings, I ſhall give ſome touches upon the ſeverall parts of your letter, paſſing by the ill language in it (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding not from your reaſon, but paſſion) and being very well aſſured, that many pious and learned men (equall to the beſt of your Approvers) doe concurre againſt you in the charge of uncharitableneſs, and do not think fit to conform themſelves to your example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad.</hi> 1. The wicked men cannot be ſaid to be hardened in their wicked wayes by us that promiſe them life onely upon Gods terms, if they repent and believe the Goſpell; Nor have they that are convinced of ſin by you at <hi>Winchcomb</hi> any other ſalve from me at <hi>Sudely</hi> to cure them but the promiſes of the Goſpell upon their Converſion. Yet do not I confeſs that every thing you call ſin, is ſo; How many good things have you called evill? That of <hi>Urſin</hi> is not pertinent unto me, for none are acquitted <hi>Verbo viſibili,</hi> that are not alſo <hi>Verbo audibili.</hi> Both wayes are they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted that are truly that which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42563:29"/>
                  <p>2. This Ordinance is no otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned than others are, by unworthy parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. Prayers of wicked men are abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why do you let them prophane your prayers at <hi>Winchcomb?</hi> As to <hi>Ezec.</hi> 44. And other places elſewhere, I muſt confeſs you have an unhappy skill in making the Scriptures look kindly upon your ſelves, and with an ill aſpect on ſuch as are not of you. Before that Text will ſerve your turn, you muſt prove our people are the uncircumciſed in heart, and gone aſtray after Idols?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Tis no guilt at all to ſee men making a ſolemn memorial of Chriſts death, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, &amp; promiſing to obey him better than they have done. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 3. Is ſure miſtaken by you, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 5. 6. juſtly condemns the countenancers of the Inceſtuous perſon, and is not pertinent to them that make an open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of all ſin. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. requires that Chriſtians which are fornicators, drunkards, &amp;c. be avoided and not eaten with, which is clearly ſpoken and interpreted by all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned interpreters (I believe) of abſtaining from familiar converſe. Yet no man denyes but ſuch are to be excluded alſo from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Table. But this muſt be done judicially. There is not wanting <hi>diligentia debita</hi> in the Miniſter when he gives inſtruction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
<pb facs="tcp:42563:29"/> and admitts none whom he knows or is informed of to be in that black rowl. The Diſcipline Authoritative in the places cited, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. is conceived to belong to other <hi>Overſeers</hi> † than you or I. Your compariſons prove nothing. Nor is the caſe alike. We give that which is good to thoſe whom we in charity ſuppoſe to be well affected. † <hi>See the Author of binding and looſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If there had been only Prayers and not wars for Reformation, many think it had been the more Chriſtian way. But Sir, was not the Reformation fought for a long time, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian? That's not yours; Nor is yours eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. I perſwade all to light and purity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I aſſiſt the true Reformation, in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piety and charity, and admitting ſuch to Communion who vow holy vowes.

                     <p>TO your Rule, <hi>where no excommunion, no communion,</hi> I anſwer, that the power of Excommunion is in the Governours of the Church, (and I conceive) belongs not unto particular Congregations. For before judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given, there muſt be a tryall by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of witneſſes, &amp;c. Do you keep ſuch a court in your Church? pray ſhew me the Commiſſion for it. Now, if the Government of the Church be hindred or excluded, the blame muſt light upon the Enemyes thereof; and particular Congregations muſt enjoy the ordinances as well as they can. Beſides, by your Rule, all the Congregations of <hi>England</hi> in former times had no right to Communion, becauſe they owned no power of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: only they could preſent faults, and ſo muſt leave them to the cognizance of their
<pb facs="tcp:42563:30"/> ſuperiors. As for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. You muſt not look upon <hi>Corinth</hi> as a ſingle Congregation, but as an Epiſcopall See, according to ſome: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to others, as governed by a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Presbyters.

                     <salute>NOble Sir,</salute>

                  <p>You are a Gentleman and a Scliolar, and in both names I have reaſon to expect courteſy from you in a fair peruſall of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, that my cauſe may not be made worſe than it is by miſapprehenſion. The ſum of the letter to which here is a Reply, is but
<pb facs="tcp:42563:32"/> this; To adminiſter the Sacrament to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as ſuch, is many wayes unlawfull; You adminiſter the Sacrament to the wicked, as ſuch; Therefore, &amp;c. A bare denyall of the Minor is ſufficient on my part, and I look upon the charge as very uncharitable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further proof. Methinks it becomes not any modeſt Chriſtian, to accuſe ſtrongly, and prove weakly. But let me retort thus; To admit to your Prayers and Sabbaths the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as ſuch is unlawfull; You admit to your Prayers and Sabbaths the wicked, as ſuch; Therefore, &amp;c. Sir, I am much miſtaken in all the practice of the Church, if excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth not as well exclude the wicked from the ſociety of prayers, as the Sacrament. By your means I hope for further light, and ſome Logicall Account of this buſineſs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. And I am willing to attend you at your Call, to be taught by any man of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian temper. I ſhall take leave to adde here ſome what relating to our diſcourſe yeſterday, concerning <hi>Judas</hi> and the Paſſover. I ſay the preſence of an hypocrite diſclos'd pollutes not the Ordinance: becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> was ſuch a one, [was he not known and diſcover'd by Chriſt, to be a Devill?] and yet he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at Chriſt's inſtitution. Conſider, I pray, of the paſſage <hi>John</hi> 13. there is mention of
<pb facs="tcp:42563:33"/> the laſt Supper. After the firſt part of it, Chriſt roſe and waſhed his Diſciples feet, then he lay down again, and proceeded to the inſtitution of the Holy Sacrament, at which <hi>Judas</hi> being preſent, received the peece of bread, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, having put his hand in the diſh, gave him. <hi>Judicent eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti.</hi> Again, I ſay, Chriſt at this Paſſover did not eat the Lamb; for the time of ſlaying the Lamb was not yet come. The Lamb was flain and eaten by the Jews, 'tis plain, after Chriſt's paſſion. For they would not enter into the Judgment-Hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>John</hi> 18. 28. What Paſſover then did Chriſt eat the night before? Not the Lamb, but unleavened Bread and bitter herbs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, followed the <hi>Poſtcoenium,</hi> wherein the Holy Sacrament was inſtituted. This I ſhall make out further at our Meeting, and you ſhall ſee we may be very confident in ſome opinions without any true ground. I am Sir,</p>

                     <hi>Si judicas cognoſce.</hi> My ſelf am beſt able to inform you, both what my Thoughts are, and what my Actions are. Ever ſince I
<pb facs="tcp:42563:39"/> was initiated into Holy Orders (which was above twenty years ſince) it hath been my Deſign in preaching (with ſincerity and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of heart, I thank God, though with much weakneſs) to commend unto my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers both the Form and the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; not one without the other, but Both; <hi>Quae Deus conjunxit</hi>—I could never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of thoſe that pretending to ſet up the Power, cry down the Form, that is, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and comely Rites and Ceremonies or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Church; nor of thoſe, that, while they were zealous for Rites and Forms, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected the Power. The Church of <hi>England</hi> I have always reverenced, I mean in reſpect of the excellent conſtitutions and Laws of it: as for corrupt practices of Officers or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters therein, I can be ſorry for them, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not defend them. And now, ſince the late obſtinate Diſorders of our people, I am more in love with the Beauty of the Church, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſtill in the ſaid conſtitutions. Till I find a better Church, I muſt have leave to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the communion of this. A cauſeleſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from it, I cannot excuſe from the crime of Schiſm. In the Miniſtration of the Sacrament I indeavor to follow the Rule ſo far as I can: and after the beſt preparation I can uſe, admit only thoſe that joyn with me in holy
<pb facs="tcp:42563:39"/> profeſſions, and ſerious and ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to lead a Chriſtian life. If I be enformed of any particular, that ſcandalouſly breaks his Vow, I will take heed how I admit him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain without ſatisfaction. But, where things are doubtful, I encline to the more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part. Private Conference, either by word or Letter, I much deſire with any of your Temper; Publick I refuſe not, if it may be quiet and orderly. Your Letter I much thank you for; I will ſtudy it, and give you Account. This general Anſwer I ſcribled, and ſent you this next morn after the receit of yours, that you may know I have kindly taken it, and that I heartily am,</p>

Expect only a few brief notes upon it, till I have the opportunity of a friendly meeting.
<pb facs="tcp:42563:40"/> You ſay you do not find but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to what I propoſed to him. My note ſhews that I offered a meeting at the place he would appoint, in the preſence of ſome diſcreet Auditors: What place can be underſtood, but a private place or houſe? as I alſo explaned my ſelf to the Baylif, that received of me the Paper, mentioning his houſe, or Mr. <hi>F</hi>'s, ſo that, it is no receding from my offer, but a refuſal of an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable demand, if I come not among the confuſed multitude. Peruſe a paſſage in <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Preface concerning publick Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Diſputes, and conſider whether Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his publike meeting will admit of any ſuch Rules. You ſay, You are <hi>grieved to hear of me as an Oppoſer of Reformation,</hi> &amp;c. If you would make it appear to me, that the work at <hi>Winchcomb,</hi> is a work of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, Oh how glad ſhould I be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute my beſt aid to it. But I <hi>adminiſter the holy things</hi> (you ſay) <hi>to Prophane Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the haters of Godlineſs, who the next hour,</hi> &amp;c. We confeſs our ſelves to God, miſerable and wretched ſinners, but we truſt in his mercy, that he will accept us (in Chriſt) not weiging <hi>our merits; but pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our offences.</hi> I ſhall uſe the beſt means I can, to find out thoſe you characterize,
<pb facs="tcp:42563:40"/> and deal with them accordingly; but after all care there may be falſe Profeſſors and Revolters in the trueſt Church. I counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance none in their corrupt and looſe waies, but on the contrary, ſhew the danger of ſuch looſeneſs, and exhort unto all Goſpel-Order: nor do I know any of my Company that do ſcornfully refuſe it. I am not guilty of the bloud of Chriſt, which I highly honour, and Miniſter to thoſe only that ſeem to me to thirſt after it, and receive it with fear and reverence, after profeſſion of Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. If by <hi>Praelatical, formal, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious uſages,</hi> you mean thoſe decent Orders and Rites which have been eſtabliſhed and uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have much to ſay for the Lawfulneſs of them, yet am ready to ſubmit to the commands of my Superiors, when they ſhall eſtabliſh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way agreeable to Gods word. I will neither ſhut my eyes againſt the light, nor reſiſt the Spirit of Chriſt, for which I daily pray. The way of holineſs, I conceive, doth not exclude laudable Forms and Cuſtoms, which ſerve for edification in holineſs. Me thinks it is very fit the body ſhould act a part in the ſervice of God with the Soul, for both are Gods. I had almoſt forgot that you ſay, I have <hi>no Call to do what I do.</hi> If
<pb facs="tcp:42563:41"/> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath as lawful a Call as I, I will ſeek Communion with him the next day I know it. The out-comers that will make uſe of my Miniſtry, I cannot deny, ſo long as they have no Paſtor that will own them upon lawful conditions: for the conditions of that ſame new Covenant are not right in the eyes of very knowing, orderly, and well-diſpoſed People. It had been, methinks, a good way to have propoſed that Covenant to debate among Neighbouring Miniſters, before it had been obtruded on the People, under penalty of loſs of Communion. The excellent Scriptures you commend unto me, I have conſidered, and will give you my ſenſe of them, when I ſee what dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions you can make thence againſt me. I do think there are as good Preachers and as holy men of that way which you call Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical, as are under Heaven: <hi>quos longè ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quar, &amp; veſtigia ſemper adoro:</hi> I ſpeak of <hi>Jewels, Hookers, Uſhers, Halls, Lakes, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews;</hi> I could weary you with names worthy of eternal memory. It is eaſy to call yours the Lord's, (they that are truly ſo I honour, not deſpiſe,) and others a <hi>looſe, dead-hearted, carnal party.</hi> For my part I judge no man, but pray that we may all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make our calling ſure, and work
<pb facs="tcp:42563:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> out our own ſalvation with fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. By the Grace of God we are what we are, if there be any good in any of us. That Spirit of Grace <hi>whoſe name</hi> (you ſay) <hi>hath been among ſome a derided thing</hi> (who have given the occaſion to that deriſion I will not ſay) is by all ſober perſons ever to be magnified and adored. Without which you ſay well, I cannot <hi>approve my ſelf a member of his body, much leſs a Miniſter of Chriſt.</hi> And therefore I pray for that Spirit, and (not expecting new Revelations) ſtudy what is the mind of the Spirit in the Holy Scripture. For the explication whereof, becauſe a late Doctor of ours, hath done more than any in this Age, I commend his paraphraſe to you on the New Teſtament, ſpecially on the Texts you cite to me: and deſire you to peruſe [<hi>Sine Studio partium</hi>] his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe prefixed concerning the <hi>New Lights:</hi> and if you look upon his Expoſition of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> you will have no cauſe to repent of your pains.

Have they not alſo (if they make for order and Edification) a <hi>reall tendency</hi> (in your phraſe) to advance Jeſus Chriſt? What tendency to this end is in the countenancing of Un-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſters, and in uſurping a Power of Government in the Church, which Chriſt hath depoſited in other hands, and in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up ignorant Perſons to be publike O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, I confeſs, Dear Sir, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.

<pb facs="tcp:42563:42"/> conceive you are of a ſweeter temper, that I mention not parts, Learning, and the like things, which (although without Grace they are not much to be valued, yet) are very uſeful and ſubſervient to the <hi>work of God.</hi> Wherein I heartily deſire to joyn with you ſo far as I can, and I hope in whatſoever we be differently minded, God will in time reveal even that to us. To his gracious dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and bleſſing I commend you and your labours, praying, that as you are endowed with precious gifts of Zeal, Elocution, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Judgement, Meekneſs, ſo you may employ them happily to the Glory of the Donor, in procuring the Unity and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of his Church.</p>

(Or, in our Pariſh-Churches?) Aff.</hi> The prior Opponent Mr. <hi>H.</hi> deſired to begin with prayer. <hi>Take your liberty,</hi> ſaid the Reſpondent, who after the Preface (wherein like a good Orator, the Opponent told the people that Truth muſt look for oppoſition, and that the Reſpondent was a native of the place, and himſelf a ſtranger) and the prayer done, ſpake thus: You will now give me leave alſo to ſpeak three words, 1. To God. 2. To the Hearers. 3. To the Opponents 1. To God I make my humble addreſs, and intreat you to lift
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42563:47"/> up your hearts with me, that he would be pleaſed to open our eyes that we may ſee the Truth, to open our Hearts that we may embrace the Truth, and to give us courage to confeſs the Truth, and to hold it faſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end, for Jeſus Chriſts ſake, to whom be glory for ever. 2. To the Hearers my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire is, that you would lay aſide all prejudice, and partiality, and liſten to what ſhall be ſaid on either ſide with ſilence and patience. And becauſe I am a man of a ſlow Tongue, of a tender Forehead, of a frail Memory, of a weak Judgement, I have the more cauſe to beg of you my friends, your ſecret aſſiſtance by your mental prayer, that God would ſupport me ſo far as I defend his cauſe. For I declare in the preſence of God, the ſearcher of hearts, that I do verily think that to be true which I maintain, and that I am not willingly an enemy to true Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or the work of God in this place (as I have been grievouſly charged,) nor am I a friend to any thing that can juſtly be called Popiſh, or Antichriſtian, God knows I deteſt and abhor it. 3. Laſtly to theſe Gentlemen my Opponents my requeſt is, that you would deal with me fairly and Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Take you your turns, and give me mine to ſpeak: come you on, one after one,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42563:48"/> and let me have liberty to repeat, to deny, to diſtinguiſh, to explain what I ſay, ſo far as is needful. And to conclude, if we cannot agree in our opinions, let us yet (I pray) be one in Affection, and preſerve amongſt us that Chriſtian Peace and Charity which is the mark and the honour of the Diſciples of our gracious Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>The Reſpondent in one of his papers afore this exerciſe had called the publick Meeting place (as they term it) the Houſe of God; But one of the Opponents Mr. <hi>W.</hi> put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and, omitting the Queſtion, began in a light velitation about that Appellation after this manner.</p>

               <p>I Anſwer, the Houſe of God, is either the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Houſe, or the <hi>Material</hi> Houſe; The Hearts of his Elect People are the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Houſe wherein it pleaſeth God to dwell and reſide; This place built by our pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anceſtors, and ſeparated from other uſes to his Honour and Service, may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be called his Material Houſe.</p>

               <p>But I muſt clear the Church from all ſuſpicion of Adoring the Saints, and make the Truth evident out of the Collect for All-Saints

The Saints are in our Prayers for <hi>imitation,</hi> not for <hi>adoration.</hi> Our Houſes therefore being truly built at firſt for God's Service, and now uſed by us for the right end, the ſetting apart of ſuch places for divine Worſhip, makes them <hi>relatively</hi> holy, and gives God a peculiar Title to them, and he owns them for <hi>his;</hi> My Houſe ſhall be called a Houſe of prayer.</p>

                  <hi>My text is in</hi> 20. Exod. <hi>where you ſhall find it a part of the fourth Commandement, Six dayes ſhalt thou labour and do all that thou haſt to do: Therefore, it is againſt Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to keep any one of the ſix dayes holy.</hi>

               <p>Worſhip not inſtituted by God is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Worſhip: But your Holy-dayes are a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip not inſtituted by God, but by human au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; therefore your holy-dayes are unlawfull Worſhip.</p>

               <p>Well, your calling by the Biſhops (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) is not lawfull, and thus I prove it. If the Scripture allowes of no Dioceſan Biſhops, then your calling by the Biſhops is not lawfull, But the Scripture allowes of no Dioceſan Biſhops; Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I allege principally the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and particularly <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. For this cauſe left I thee in <hi>Creet,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42563:51"/>
                  <q>that thou ſhouldſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordaine Elders in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City, as I have appointed thee.</q> Out of which Text I will prove that <hi>Titus</hi> was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and <hi>Creet</hi> his Dioceſe, and therefore here we have found the Dioceſian Biſhop. But before I proceed, let me aske you, Gentlemen, do you not put me upon this to enſnare me? Do you mean no harm to me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>No I aſſure you; wherefore in Gods Name ſpeak freely.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I humbly thank you: but firſt let me openly declare before all this Aſſembly, that I have no mind to oppoſe any act of State, nor will I meddle at all with the <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> of Biſhops, only I plead for the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Function</hi> of Biſhops, I plead for the primitive Apoſtolicall Biſhop and no other; And that this Text is for me, thus I prove: He that hath a power to ordaine Elders, and ſet things in order in the Church is a Biſhop: But <hi>Titus</hi> hath a power to ordaine Elders, and to ſet things in order in a Church: Therefore <hi>Titus</hi> is a Biſhop.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>But you muſt prove him to be a Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhop.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>So I do. <hi>Creet</hi> was his Dioceſe; the whole Iland was committed to his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Dioceſe,</hi> my friends, is a Greek word

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Cities were not under</hi> Titus <hi>his Goverment, he was not a Ruler of the Iland.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>He was Ruler of all the Chriſtians (I mean onely them) through all the Cities and Country.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Titus <hi>was an Evangeliſt: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I deny the Conſequence: He was an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> while he went about Preaching and Planting the Goſpell, And he was the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> of <hi>Creet</hi> when he was fixed there by <hi>Paul</hi> to Ordaine Elders, and put in order the things that were wanting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>We find</hi> Titus <hi>in other places beſide</hi> Creet, <hi>and Biſhops of thoſe times were not non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſidents: Therefore he was not Biſhop of</hi> Creet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Biſhops may lawfully be (and were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently) <hi>non-reſident</hi> for ſome time, to wit, while they attend the buſineſs of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and procured the greater good of the Church: In which time of their abſence their places are ſupplyed at home by their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But Sir, I pray, conſider</hi> Titus <hi>was an extraordinary Governor, and therefore no Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Biſhop. And you diſpute fallaciouſly, unleſs you put in the word Ordinary.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay he was a Dioceſan Biſhop, or (if you will) rather an <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Elders of every City to have been <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Overſeers</hi> of ſeverall Miniſters and Congregations: therefore he was an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Governour. Thus I argue: He that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines Elders, and orders the things in the Churches, is an Ordinary: But <hi>Titus</hi> ordaines Elders, and orders things in the Churches; Therefore <hi>Titus</hi> is an Ordinary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
               <p>But I mean he was called to that office in an extraordinary manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No neither. He was called in the ſame manner as <hi>Timothy</hi> and others, by Impoſition of the Presbytery: Therefore He was called in an Ordinary manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>A. Timothy <hi>was called (ſaith</hi> Paul <hi>in another place) by the laying on of his hands.</hi>

               <p>Noble Sir, you ſay very true; and the places are eaſily reconciled thus: Divers El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders laid hands on <hi>Timothy,</hi> among whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> probably was chief.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And was</hi> Paul <hi>too a Dioceſan Biſhop?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Apoſtles <hi>common</hi> Dioceſe was the whole world, which by agreement they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42563:53"/> among them: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> the Apoſtle of the Gentiles. But in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> I grant ſome things are <hi>extraordinary,</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pray, make it out cleerely that</hi> Titus <hi>his caſe is not extraordinary, otherwiſe you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute fallaciouſly.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Truth needs no ſophiſtry. Thus I make it out. The office that is to continue in the Church, and to be ſucceeded in through fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ages, is no extraordinary office: But this office of <hi>Titus</hi> is ſuch; Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>What? is it to continue to the worlds end?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, to the worlds end. For it is Chriſts Promiſe; I am with you alway even to the end of the world. <hi>Mat. ult. ult.</hi> What ſay you to my argument? Ordination and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction are Offices or Powers needfull to the Church in all Ages: This Office of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or <hi>Titus</hi> was Ordination and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Therefore this Office of <hi>Titus</hi> is needfull to the Church in all Ages, and therefore no extraordinary Office. And my Brethren, I would have you to know, we are able to ſhew out of the beſt Records and Monuments of the Antient Church, that there was a <hi>ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to the Apoſtolicall Biſhops in theſe parts of their Office; And the <hi>Catalogues</hi> of ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Biſhops in ſeverall Apoſtolicall Sees are

               <p>See, godly Brethren, the ſubtilty of this man: He will not contain himſelf within the Holy Scripture, but tells us of Fathers and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Stories, and human Authorities.</p>

               <p>I do and muſt; and thus I argue: That Government which in the primitive Ages took place in the Churches planted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, is the Apoſtolicall and Scripture Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: But the Government of Dioceſan Biſhops took place in the Churches planted by the Apoſtles; Therefore the Government of the Dioceſan Biſhops is the Apoſtolicall and Scripture Government. Now let me ſee who will anſwer me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>Antichriſt, Antichriſt was working be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Whether it be <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, or to over throw the Function of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42563:54"/> let all conſidering men judge by the Premiſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>But why do you take in any thing elſe with Scripture, as if that alone were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Yea Scripture, Scripture, we are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Scripture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Give me leave to explain my ſelf to All, and I entreat you, Harken, The Scriptures perfection I do thankfully acknowledge: but the things conteined in the Scripture are ſome of them conteined in it <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>expreſly,</hi> to be apprehended by every Reader; other things are conteined there <hi>implicitely, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> and ſo as there is need of many helps to make our deductions thence. And for the Scripture-government I know no better light to ſhew it than the practice of the Antient Church. I argue thus: They that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us the very Books of Scripture are fitteſt to give us the ſenſe of them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in point of Government: But the Antient Church hath commended to us the very books of Scripture; Therefore the Antient Church is fitteſt to give us the ſenſe, &amp;c. And I pray Mr. <hi>W.</hi> how will you prove that the Scripture is the Word of God?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>I know it by the Teſtimony of the Holy Spirit in me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42563:55"/>B.</speaker>
               <p>But how will you convince another that will not believe your Spirit, that the Scripture is divine? Here you may make very good uſe of the Teſtimony of the next Ages, that received it from the Apoſtles and gave it down to their Followers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>W. and H.</speaker>
               <p>Popery, to depend upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>Since you are many at once upon one (which is not fair) give me leave to put in ſometimes in behalf and for the caſe of the Reſpondent. We ſay, we depend upon the teſtimony of the <hi>Antient</hi> Church, not of the <hi>now Roman</hi> Church. The Roman Church is a very corrupt Church, the Primitive times were far more pure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>What do you talk of Purity after the Apoſtles times? Did not many Hereſies creep in?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>By this Argument you will condemn the Apoſtles times alſo: for even then were not wanting Schiſmes and Hereſies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Will you leave this as it is, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſome farther Argument, and come cloſe to the buſineſs of the Sacrament? I ſay, it is lawfull for me to Miniſter the Sacrament in the Congregation at <hi>Sudeley.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus I proceed to ſhew, that your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is null: therefore you cannot Miniſter.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42563:55"/> Miniſters that Prophane the holy things of the Lord, their calling is null: But many Pariſh Miniſters prophane the holy things of the Lord; Therefore their Calling is null.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You ſhould ſay <hi>All Pariſh Miniſters:</hi> for you hold it is not lawful to Miniſter in any mixt Congregation, and ſuch you ſay are all Pariſh Churches. But ſay neither <hi>All,</hi> nor <hi>Many,</hi> but apply the <hi>minor</hi> to me, whom you have publikely in your Sermons condemned (before you uſed the Chriſtian wayes of more private Admonition:) and then I deny both your premiſes, both <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> both are falſe and Scandalous. Neither doth the prophaning of Holy things null the Miniſters calling: nor have I prophaned the Holy things in the ſaid Miniſtery.</p>

               <p>

               <p>What prove you thence?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>That prophaning the Holy things nulls the Prieſthood, for they ſhall be no Prieſts unto me, ſaith the Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer to the Text, by diſtinguiſhing between the <hi>Order</hi> of a Prieſt, and the <hi>Office</hi> of a Prieſt. They ſhall be no Prieſts <hi>unto me:</hi> here is a ſuſpenſion from the Office and work of the Prieſts, no nulling of the Prieſthood it ſelf.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42563:56"/>W.</speaker>
               <p>Then it ſeems by you. They were Prieſts and no Prieſts. God ſaith, They ſhall not; you ſay, they ſhall remain Prieſts.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>He hath ſhewed you how. They were Prieſts and no Prieſts in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: They were ſtill of the <hi>Order</hi> and race of Prieſts, they were not to <hi>officiate</hi> any more in the Prieſtly office. God would not accept them, he ſaith, <hi>They ſhall be no Prieſts unto me.</hi> Yet who knoweth but upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance God might readmit them, not by a new Conſecration, but by <hi>Abſolution.</hi> And ſo Miniſters, when they are reſtored after ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, are not new <hi>Ordained,</hi> but only the <hi>Cenſures</hi> taken off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
               <p>Well, you grant at laſt a removall and ſuſpenſion from the office, though the calling be not nulled: And ſo you will confeſs you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be removed from Officiating, if you prophane the Holy Things of the Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I will grant, that a Miniſter, if he be ſo prophane, ought not to officiate: but I think the proceedings againſt a Miniſter muſt be tender and wary; <hi>Receive not an accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt an Elder without two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi> Conviction muſt go before Cenſure, and upon Repentance reſtauration followes.

               <p>We thank the Lord, Brethren, that the good work is ſo happily brought to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion this day.

I know them not, ſome of them, by name, I have no familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them, I do not know them in civil relations: but I do know them, and own them in a religious relation.

               <p>Hear me out. I do not only know no hurt by them, but I know much good by

An ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> joyned with <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>thankfulneſs</hi> ſatisfies me very well for the time, till I find they do deceive me.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>God forbid you ſhould have hurt for telling any one a <hi>neceſſary truth.</hi> For my part, I think and hope the beſt of all, that promiſe fair, I Judge according to <hi>charity.</hi> I know one may act the <hi>Saint</hi> to day, and the <hi>Devil</hi> to morrow. Let me tell you, 'tis the judgement of our Church, after the Fathers, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> delivered the Sacrament to <hi>Judas</hi> alſo, who went out immediatly after to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him; and, before that, was diſcovered by his Maſter to be a Devill. You will not grant this: however, you know <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that was ſo zealous, upon triall, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next day denied his Maſter, yea denied him with <hi>curſing and ſwearing.</hi> All the reſt forſook him and fled. Their ſtrength was little, and their knowledge was leſs: witneſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42563:58"/> the Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus, fools and ſlow of heart,</hi> and the queſtion propoſed about the Kingdom, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. What is the loweſt meaſure of grace I will not determine. Where I ſee any hopes or weak beginnings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, I embrace and cheriſh them. In the School of Chriſt there be many little ones, that muſt be gently uſed; and there be ſome great ones, that muſt not be offended, but upon great reaſons. Why ſhould I not think better of others than my ſelf, when the <hi>B.</hi> Apoſtle calls himſelf the <hi>chiefeſt of ſinners,</hi> and leſs than the leaſt of Saints? He that hath beams to caſt out of his own eve, muſt not be picking motes out of his Brothers eye. 'Tis true the Brother muſt be admoniſhed, eſpecially by the Miniſter: but this muſt be done diſcreetly and orderly, and with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit. He that obeys <hi>one,</hi> or a <hi>few,</hi> ſcapes the cenſure of the <hi>Many:</hi> and may not be reckoned as an alien. None is ſo, but he that proves obſtinate after the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Counſel and Reproof. And verily, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> it had been a good method for you, to have admoniſht me and the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, whom you are offended with, and to have received our Anſwer, before you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd us in your Pulpit. And that Anſwer will ſerve now: In what we have offended God,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42563:58"/> we ask his pardon: In what we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you, we will give you ſatisfaction. Thus doing, we ſhall not be excluded from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by any juſt ſentence.</p>

And I do often commend and endeavour to bring into better practice, the Duty of fraternall Admonition and Correption, which is now the more neceſſary, becauſe we want publick Diſcipline [ſee D. <hi>Hammond</hi> of Fraternall Admonition] Having declared my ſelf thus, I muſt conclude your Argument againſt my Communicants, till you prove your Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion better, to be only an Argument of your own uncharitableneſs.</p>

               <p>What if I cannot?

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42563:62"/> a heathen, and might be proſecuted for any offence before the heathen Tribunalls, Which proſecution was not lawfull againſt thoſe that would hear the Church. [See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.] But this will do you no pleaſure, unleſs that which followes in the next verſe belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Congregation too: but that cannot be, if Chriſt ſpake the words to his Apoſtles, and gave the Keys, and Power of Binding and Looſing to them and their ſucceſſors, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he did.

               <p>Noble Sir, I anſwer, <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the new Teſtament, are alſo called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but they are more than thoſe we now call Presbyters, who are to be ordained and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Biſhops. Any Presbyter may be called Biſhop or Overſeer of his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but thoſe we eminently ſtile Biſhops now, who are Biſhops, or Overſeers and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of thoſe Pariſh Biſhops or Presbyters. The Presbyters St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſent for from <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> were properly Biſhops.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>No, Hear my Argument. The Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>was but one Congregation. I prove it out of</hi> Eph. 2. <hi>the two laſt verſes: In whom (Jeſus Chriſt) all the building fitly framed together,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A building fitly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42563:63"/> together is but one Congregation: But the Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>was a building fitly framed together; Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>To the Major. Not only one ſingle Congregation, but many united under one Biſhop may be ſo called. And that <hi>Epheſus</hi> was not a ſingle Independent Congregation, but a Metropolitical Church, you may learn of the moſt Reverend Primate Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> a man I think of great Authority among you alſo, as among all Scholars, moſt juſtly. I refer you to his Geographical Tract of the Aſian Dioceſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Return to the Text,</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>v. 19. I ſhall prove it undeniably, that a ſingle Church hath an independent power. But firſt will you grant me, that two or three may be taken for a ſmall Congregation?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Then thus I argue: Where is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Bleſſing, there is the Power: But in a ſmall Congregation [where two or three,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>is both the duty and the Bleſſing; Therefore there is alſo the Power, namely of Excommunication.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Where is the duty,</hi> &amp;c. You leave out a very neceſſary word, <hi>Independent.</hi> For ſuppoſing that a power of Excommunication
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42563:64"/> were in a particular Congregation, I cannot grant it is there <hi>independently,</hi> but there may be an Appeal: But did you ever hear of an Indepent Church of two or three?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, there may be a Church of ſo few, and that independent.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>private</hi> Church, I grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> enabled with power of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a power ſupreme.

               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Did you not grant to Mr.</hi> Tr. <hi>that two or three may be taken for any ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? now you recall your words. You know, if there be twenty in a company, we ſometimes ſay there be two or three.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No indeed, that's too far wide. Let the people judge of this, whether any will ſay there be two or three, if there be twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſons met in a room. Two or three, that is, twenty. (ſilence I pray!) But Sir, the words of Chriſt are verified, if there be but barely two. And therefore I may juſtly think it too ſmall a number to make the Church, mentioned v: 17. It cannot be for this reaſon.

               <p>I remember well, I have heard the Learned Doctor of the Chair, Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> publickly declaring in the Divinity School, that he could not prove the obſervation of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42563:69"/> Lords day by Divine Command, in any place of the New Teſtament, but that the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall practice and example followed by the Church, was ſufficient to give it a kind of Divine right; The like may be ſaid for Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.

               <p>Another of the Opponents Mr. <hi>Tr.</hi> asked the Reſpondent, whether he did not Preach before he was Ordained: Yes, ſaid he, once or twice in this Church above twenty years ſince, being Mr of Arts, and after that Tryall of my ſelf, I entred into Orders. Your men

               <p>Where the Reſpondent diſtinguiſheth of Biſhops as <hi>Lords</hi> &amp; as <hi>Fathers,</hi> he would not have the Reader ſuſpect him as if he envied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temporall Honour or Riches to the Fathers of the Church.

Our Mother <hi>Oxford</hi> eſpecially cannot forget how magnificent Founders and Benefactors ſhe hath had of this ſacred Order.</p>
               <p>One of the Opponents, about admiſſion of people to the Sacrament, urged that prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall ſpeech of Chriſt <hi>Matth. 7. 16. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles?</hi> No, ſaid the Reſpondent, while they <hi>continue</hi> ſuch, but on their <hi>Converſion</hi> they may. For the true ſenſe of that place hear the Divine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſt. <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi>] Ye ſhall certainly know them and diſcern
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42563:70"/> them, if you take notice of, and weigh the doctrins, which when they have gotten ſome Authority with you, they will preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to infuſe into you. They that make no other uſe of their being counted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but to infuſe higher degrees of all kind of piety and charity into you, ye may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve they are ſent from God. For the Devill would never help men to credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world, who ſhould make uſe of it only to the advancement of piety. But if their deſigns be to infuſe into their followers any ſeeds of impiety, injuſtice, uncleanneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, ſedition, rebellion, &amp;c. Let their pretences and behaviour be never ſo fair, be ſure they are falſe Prophets.</p>
               <p>When it was ſaid by the Reſpondent that Chriſt died for all men: one <hi>Cr.</hi> a diſciple of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> was heard to ſay, <hi>Then, it ſeems, Chriſt dyed for the Devills and all:</hi> not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Divine Text to the <hi>Hebrews, 2. 16.

               <p>It is very true, that I told you, the firſt draught of that diſpute was the work but of one day, while the memory of it was freſh: and the carefull obſerver is no other than the Reſpondent himſelf, who is not aſhamed to own as well the penning as the publiſhing of it. My worthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> friend, that ſtood <hi>in ſubſidiis,</hi> if he hath noted any conſiderable Defect in it, may do well, as I requeſted him, to ſend me his ſupplement. But the ſetting down an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymen for a Syllogiſm, and the omiſſion of little matters on the by, I conceive is no very conſiderable want. Indeed there was a paſſage between him and the opponents concerning the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I found not the particulars in my frail memory, I mentioned not. Now Sir, for the proceeding againſt me at <hi>Winchcomb</hi> the laſt week, which together with a very frivolous report about the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> (in the inquiry whereof, methinks, the Religion of an oath was made cheap.) was the buſineſs of the three Juſtices, I muſt tell you what good people ſay; That the new-ſaints there diſcover what they are by their pride
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42563:75"/> and ſpightfulneſs; That they procured war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to fetch in ſome of my neighbours to ſwear againſt me for uſing the <hi>Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book,</hi> who are not ſo Book-learned, that they can well tell when I uſe it, when not: That they, ſome of them, gave this falſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that on the Monday ſollowing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, when Mr. <hi>Helme</hi> would not appear, I had drawn to the Church a company (you were one) of lewd perſons: That the Juſtices have not obliged me by any humanity or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity toward me, ſuffering me to be accuſed by ſuch fellowes in my abſence, that—But no more of this now. To conclude this ſcribble, I would have all know, that I do forgive my Adverſaries (whom I have aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cool by kind letters) and that I do not fear them: that I am well affected to all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, by which I am protected, and that I am ſo well opinioned of the preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that I believe he will at leaſt tolerate that Religion, wherein himſelf, as well as we, were once baptiz'd.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42563:76"/> of Meetings.</hi> It is good to be wiſe and wary; but to omit the means and opportunity of doing good in our Callings, even when there is ſome ſhew of perill to our ſelves, I doubt will argue rather a timorous deſerting of our Cauſe, than a prudent warineſs. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt not only labour ſingle and in their own Cures, but by a brotherly union, and mutual aſſiſtance, advance the work of their Maſter, and procure the peace of the Church. When ſo many unlearned new Teachers, both ſingle and united, ſhew ſuch zeal to make proſelytes, ſhall we that have gone through the Schools to S. <hi>Maryes,</hi> and through uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity degrees have aſcended the Pulpit, and by a regular miſſion are employed in our ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhall we I ſay let the people loſe the fruit of our long ſtudyes, ſhall we be cold and heartleſs, and ſuffer our ſheep to wander as if they had no ſhepheards? You <hi>writ</hi> to me, <hi>That the Truth and our Cauſe did not ſuffer by my Diſpute, but my friends fear is, that I in my eſtate may ſuffer in defenſe thereof.</hi> Truly Sir, the grave judgment of you and other friends, that I have done ſome ſervice to a good Cauſe, doth more comfort me, than your fears of my ſuffering can diſcourage me. I think upon the Pſalmiſts words, <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and be doing good.</hi> I think upon Gods words to <hi>Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42563:76"/> Be not afraid, but ſpeak and hold not thy peace: For I am with thee.</hi> I think upon <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to the <hi>Philippians, To you it is given not only to believe, but to ſuffer.</hi> I think upon Chriſt's words, <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you and perſecute you for my ſake: Rejoyce and be exceeding glad.</hi> I need not comment upon theſe paſſages, nor apply them. Aſſure your ſelf, I am not afraid to ſuffer, as a Chriſtian. My eſtate indeed is but ſmall; if it were great, God forbid I ſhould love it more than a good Conſcience. I am in hope to keep both ſafe; and my hope is confirmed, ſince I hear, that at the very ſame time when our Adverſaries were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving to undo me and other of my worthy brethren, The Generall was declared Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, who is ſaid to be of a moderate, and a gentle, and obliging Diſpoſition. From whom I may juſtly expect ſuch a preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my place, whereby I may be able (which is all my ambition) to breed up my five little Boys, to fear God, to love their Countrey, and to obey their ſuperiours.</p>

That he Chriſtned ſuch a mans child with the <hi>ſign of the Croſs:</hi> in token that he ſhould not be aſham'd to confeſs the faith of Chriſt crucified. 4. That he dined at an Ordinary with the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> at <hi>Winchcomb.</hi> [About whom there hath been much a doe among thoſe Juſtices, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of themſelves and their office to much contempt among the people.] <hi>Terrible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles!</hi> But, ſince the <hi>Diſſolution,</hi> the Men are not terrible: ſo that I may baniſh them from my ſtudies, and return unto my <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi> or, rather uſe the words of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Return unto thy reſt, O my Soul, for the Lord hath been good to thee.

And this evill, although it can have no excuſe, yet it hath a great and a certain cauſe. For the Word of God ſtill creates new Appetites, as it ſatisfies the old; and enlarges the capacity, as it fills the firſt propenſities of the Spirit.

                  </gap>, the bitterneſs of zeal; and it is a certain temptation to every man againſt his duty: for if the Sword turns Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher and dictates Propoſitions by Empire inſtead of Arguments, and engraves them in mens hearts with a Ponyard, that it ſhall be death to believe what I innocently and ignorantly am perſwaded of, it muſt needs be unſafe to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> to <hi>try all things,</hi> to make enquiry. And yet without this liberty, no man can juſtify himſelf before God or man, nor confidently ſay, that his Religion is beſt: ſince he cannot without a final danger make himſelf able to give a right ſentence, and to follow that which he finds to be the beſt. This may ruin Souls by making Hypocrits, or careleſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyant againſt conſcience or without it; but it doth not ſave Souls, though peradventure it ſhould force them to a good opinion. This is inordination of zeal. For Chriſt by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoving St. <hi>Peter</hi> drawing his Sword, even in the cauſe of Chriſt, for his ſacred and yet

This is the zeal that is now in faſhion, and hath almoſt ſpoiled Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Men like the zealots of the Jews cry up their Sect, and in it their Intereſt, they affect Diſciples and fight againſt the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents: And we ſhall find in Scripture, that when the Apoſtles began to Preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the meekneſs of the Chriſtian inſtitution, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and promiſes, charity and humility, there was a zeal ſet up againſt them.

               <p>AGain it may juſtly be feared, whether our Engliſh Nobility, when the matter came in tryal, would contentedly ſuffer themſelves to be alwaies at the call, and to ſtand to the ſentence of a number of mean perſons aſſiſted with the preſence of their poor teacher, a man (as ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) though better able to ſpeak, yet little or no whit apter to judge than the reſt. From whom, be their dealings never ſo abſurd (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be by way of complaint to a Synod) no appeal may be made unto any one of higher power: in as much as the order of your Diſcipline admitteth no ſtanding ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Courts, no Spiritual Judge to have any ordinary Superior on earth, but as many Supremacies, as there are Pariſhes and ſeveral Congregations. Neither is it altogether without cauſe that ſo many do fear the overthrow of all learning, as a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſequel of this your intended Diſcipline. For if the worlds preſervation depend upon the multitude of the wiſe; and of that ſort
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42563:84"/> the number hereafter be not likely to wax over great, when (that wherewith the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> profeſſeth himſelf at the heart grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) men of underſtanding are already ſo little ſet by: how ſhould their minds, whom the love of ſo precious a Jewel filleth with ſecret jealouſy, even in regard of the leaſt things which may any way hinder the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing eſtate thereof, chooſe but miſdoubt, leſt this Diſcipline, which alwaies you match with Divine Doctrine, as her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and true Siſter, be found unto all kinds of knowledge a Stepmother; ſeeing that the greateſt worldly hopes, which are propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto the chiefeſt kind of learning, yee ſeek utterly to extirpate as weeds: and have grounded your platform on ſuch Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as do after a ſort undermine thoſe moſt renowned habitations, where through the goodneſs of Almighty God all commendable Arts and Sciences are with exceeding great induſtry hitherto (and ſo may they for ever continue) ſtudied, proceeded in, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.

               <p>THe Socinians ſay, <hi>Cum adhuc nova,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtles had a call when the Goſpel was newly publiſhed: there needs not a Miniſtry now that the Goſpel is generally taught, and it is promiſed we ſhall be all taught of God. If we ſhould look for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, where ſhall we find it? Our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtets were ordained by Biſhops, they by the Pope: Therefore their Calling is Anti-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. <hi>But,</hi> That there is ſuch an Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, and this to continue till the worlds end, may be thus proved. Firſt, there are ſome to whom the word of reconciliation is committed, and not to others. 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 18.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42563:85"/> is forthwith to me rejected, but only that which he doth, <hi>qua Antichriſtus,</hi> as he is Antichriſt. But Biſhops were before ever Antichriſt appeared in the world.—<hi>Brown</hi> the father of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> was the firſt of note that did ſeparate himſelf from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſaid, that we had no Church; he meant a true Church; But after he went into <hi>France,</hi> and being at <hi>Geneva,</hi> he ſaw the Sabbath much prophaned, and the wafer-cake given in the Sacrament inſtead of bread; whereupon he began to think better of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and returning home he became Paſtor of a Church in <hi>Northham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton-ſhire,</hi> called <hi>Achurch.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church; the Reformed Churches ſeparated from it becoming a falſe Church. Though Miniſters were ordained in the moſt corrupt eſtate of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet if they forſake the corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they are true Miniſters, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf if it would caſt off its Corruptions, ſhould be a true Church.</p>
               <p>There is a double <hi>Calling</hi> neceſſary to a diſpenſor of the Myſteries of ſalvation, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>Outward.</hi> The Inward enableth men, the Outward authorizeth them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their ſacred function. Where there are Gifts, if God encline the heart of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42563:86"/> party to enter into the Miniſtry, there is an inward Calling: Yet this alone ſufficeth not without an outward Calling, either <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary.</hi> We are not now to expect extraordinary callings ſince Miracles are ceaſed. The Ordinary calling is by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the hands of the Presbytery, <hi>Jer. 14. 14. &amp; 27. 15. Rom.</hi> 10. 5.

               <p>In the Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> the people give no voice in the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miniſters, but are only permitted, if they have any cauſes of diſlike or exception, to make them known to the paſtors &amp; guides of the Church, and the power of judging ſuch exceptions reſteth wholly in them. When one <hi>Morelius</hi> a phantaſticall companion ſought to bring the Elections of Biſhops and Miniſters to be popular, and ſwayed by the moſt voices of the people, he was condemned by all the Synods in <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> ſheweth, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 83.</p>

               <p>LEt not any man think now that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle communicateth this power with the Congregation of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when he writeth to them, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4, 5. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled with his ſpirit, to deliver the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon to Satan.</hi> For it is plain, that the ſentence is given by the Apoſtle <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. where he writeth: <hi>For I verily, as abſent in body but preſent in ſpirit, have judged already, as though I were preſent, concerning him that hath ſo done this deed.</hi> And to cauſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to be the better digeſted, he hath vouched his power in the end of the chapter afore, <hi>verſe 18. Now ſome are puffed up, as though I would not come unto you: but I will come unto you ſhortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the ſpeech of them that are puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up, but the power. What will you? ſhall I come unto you with a rod, or with the ſpirit of meekneſs?</hi> Which power otherwhiles he ſetteth before them, in caſe of their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And therefore it muſt be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he writeth to them to ſee his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence publiſhed, ratified and executed: which the Presbyters there had either neglected to do, or perhaps were not able to bring the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42563:101"/> people under the Diſcipline of Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which muſt needs oblige the Apoſtle to interpoſe.—And this without doubt is the reaſon why the Apoſtle writeth in theſe terms 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 12. For what have I to do to judge thoſe that are without? do not ye judge thoſe that are within?</hi> ſpeaking to the Church in general, though the ſentence paſſed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Presbyters; becauſe matters were cenſured in the Congregation, and executed by the people. And thus the practice of that time giveth a reaſon without ſtraining, why our Lord ſeemeth to refer theſe matters to the Congregation, when he ſaith, <hi>Tell it to the Church,</hi> becauſe they paſſed at their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, though under Cenſure of Biſhop and Presbyters. And great reaſon there is, why this regard ſhould be had by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and by the Church afterwards, to the People; becauſe the Church, being a meer ſpiritual Commonwealth, and not indued with temporal ſtrength, ſo much as to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thoſe ſentences which the power of the Keys given by Chriſt obligeth it to inflict (always ſetting wide that power of working miracles, which was in the Apoſtle, upon which ſome think he reflecteth in ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of thoſe Epiſtles;) requiſite it was then, the Congregation ſhould be ſatisfied of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42563:102"/> courſe of thoſe proceedings which muſt come into execution and effect by their voluntary ſubmiſſion to the will of God, and the office of his Miniſters: And, as the matter is now, that things of this nature proceed not upon mens private Conſciences and Judgments in particulars, but upon general rules of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right, requiſite it is, that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth have ſatisfaction of thoſe Laws accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which the Church now muſt proceed in their cenſures, it being acknowledged that they cannot proceed with effect but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of thoſe Laws that are put in force by the ſecular Arm. <hi>Mr. Thorndike of Prim.

Other diſputation againſt their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions than only by allegation of Scripture they would not hear: beſides it, they thought no other writings in the world ſhould be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed, in ſo much as one of their great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets exhorting them to caſt away all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects unto human writings, ſo far to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they condeſcended, that as many as had any Books, ſave the Holy Bible, in their cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they brought and ſet them publickly on fire. When they and their Bibles were alone together, what ſtrange phantaſticall opinion ſoever at any time enterd into their heads, their uſe was to think the Spirit taught it them.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42563:103"/> Baptizing of Infants, although confeſt by themſelves to have been continued ever ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence the Apoſtles own times, yet they altogether condemned. The Euchariſt they received (pretending our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours example) after Supper; and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all thoſe impieties which have been grounded upon the myſticall words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body, This is my Blood,</hi> they thought it not ſafe to mention either body or blood in that Sacrament, but rather to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate both, and to uſe no words but theſe, <hi>Take, eate, declare the death of our Lord; Drink, ſhew forth our Lords Death.</hi> In rites and ceremonies, their profeſſion was hatred of all conformity with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for which cauſe they would rather endure any torment, than obſerve the ſolemn <hi>Feſtivals</hi> which others did, in as much as <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (they ſaid) was the firſt inventor of them. The pretended end of their civil reformation was, <hi>that Chriſt might have dominion over all,</hi> that all Crowns and Scepters might be thrown down at his feet, that no other might reign over Chriſtian men but He, no regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to keep them in awe but his diſciplin; amongſt them no ſword at all to be carried, beſides his, the ſword of ſpirituall excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. They laboured to bring in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42563:103"/> of goods, becauſe Chriſt by his Apoſtles hath given the world ſuch example, to the end that men might excell one another not in wealth the pillar of ſecular Authority, but in vertue. Theſe men at the firſt were only pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed in their errour, and by a mercifull To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration they gatherd ſtrength, much more than was ſafe for the ſtate of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth wherein they lived. The means whereby they both allured and reteined ſo great multitudes were moſt effectuall: Firſt, a wonderfull ſhew of zeall towards God, wherewith they ſeemed to be even rapt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing they ſpake. Secondly, an hatred of ſin, and a ſingular love of integrity, which men did think to be much more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in them, by reaſon of the cuſtome which they had to fill the ears of the people with invectives againſt their authorized guides, as well Spirituall as Civill. Thirdly, the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull relief wherewith they eaſed the broken eſtate of ſuch needy creatures, as were in that reſpect the more apt to be drawn away. Fourthly, a tender compaſſion which they were thought to take upon the miſeries of the common ſort, over whoſe hearts their manner was even to powr down ſhowers of tears in complaining that no reſpect was had unto them. Laſtly, a cunning ſlight which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42563:104"/> they had to ſtroke and ſmooth up the minds of their Followers, as well by appropriating unto them all the favourable titles, the good words, and the gracious promiſes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as alſo by caſting the contrary always on the heads of ſuch as were ſevered from that retinue. Whereupon the peoples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Acclamation unto ſuch Deceivers was, Theſe are verily the men of God, theſe are his true and ſincere Prophets.—Nothing more clear unto their ſeeming, than that a <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> being often ſpoken of in Scriptures, they undoubtedly were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that New Jeruſalem, and the Old did by way of a certain figurative reſemblance ſignify what they ſhould both be and do. Here they drew in a Sea of matter by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things unto their own company which are any where ſpoken concerning divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and benefits beſtowed upon the old Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concluding that as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was deliverd out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo they ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually out of the <hi>Egypt</hi> of the worlds ſervile thraldom unto ſin and ſuperſtition; as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to root out the Idolatrous Nations, and to plant in ſtead of them a people which fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, ſo the Lords good will and pleaſure was now, that theſe new <hi>Iſraelits</hi> ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of other <hi>Joſhuas, Samſons,</hi>

Now whatſoever they did in ſuch ſort collect out of Scripture, when they came to juſtify or perſwade it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, all was the heavenly Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, his Commandement, his will and charge.</p>
            <p>Theſe men in whoſe mouths at the firſt ſounded nothing but onely mortification of the fleſh, were come at the length to think, they might lawfully have their ſix or ſeven wives apeece; They which at the firſt taught judgment and juſtice it ſelf to be mercileſs cruelly, accompted at the length their own hands ſanctified with being imbrued in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian blood; They who at the firſt were wont to beat down all dominion, had at the length both Conſuls and Kings of their own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt themſelves; Finally, they which could not brook at the firſt, that any man ſhould ſeek, no not by law, the recovery of goods injuriouſly taken or withheld from him, were grown at the laſt to think they could not offer unto God more acceptable ſacrifice, than by turning their Adverſaries clean out of houſe and home, and by enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with all kind of ſpoil and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42563:105"/> which thing being layd to their charge, they had in a readineſs their anſwer, that now the time was come, when according to our Saviours promiſe, The Meek ones muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Earth.</p>
